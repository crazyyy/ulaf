To configure the plugin, you need a valid Telegram API token. Its easy to get starting a Telegram Bot.
You can learn about obtaining  tokens and generating new ones in 

[my tutorial post] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCa54OhOm9Vm0Jz2AUjQUHK71djzOUQBDZF-9NH7irU/)

[this document](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather/ "Obtaining tokens and generating new ones")  
or follow the info in [this post](https://medium.com/shibinco/create-a-telegram-bot-using-botfather-and-get-the-api-token-900ba00e0f39 "Create a Telegram bot using BotFather and Get the Api Token")  
You also need at least one "chatid" number, that is the recipient to the message will be send. To know you personal chatid number, search on telegram app for "@get_id_bot" or  
[click here ](https://telegram.me/chatIDrobot/ "@chatIDrobot")  OR  another bot @RawDataBot [click here ](https://t.me/RawDataBot)  


Once You got the 2 fields save the configuration and try the "TEST" button .. you should receive a message in you telegram : "WOW IT WORKS" !! If not, check token and chatid fields again for the correct values.

this plugin is relying on a 3rd party service to geolocate the Ip address https://ip-api.com/
https://ip-api.com/docs/legal  to see the services’ a terms of use and/or privacy policies


MESSAGES TRANSLATION
To translate Telegram messages, use WPML or Loco Translate. All notification strings are now translatable.
Go to Loco Translate → Plugins → Notification for Telegram to add your translations.
For WPML, ensure String Translation is enabled to modify notification texts.


SHORTCODE EXAMPLE

`[telegram_mess  message="Im so happy" chatids="0000000," token="000000000:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" showsitename="1" showip="1" showcity="1" ]`


SHORTCODE OPTIONS:

* message : Your message to be sent. Example (message="hello world")

* chatids : Recipient(s) who will receive your message separated by comma (example chatids="0000000,11111111") , If not present this field  the shortcode will use default value in Plugin option page.

* token:  The token looks something like 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11 
If not present this field, the shortcode will use default value in Plugin option page.

* showsitename: if set to "1" appends sitename after the message. Defaultvalue is "0" Example (showsitename="1")

* showip: if set to "1" appends user ip address after the message. Default value is "0" Example (showip="1")

?>`

** WOOCOMERCE FILTER HOOKS **

We have created 4 filter hooks for WooCommerce order notification message. 4 new positions: Message Header, Message Footer, before Items, and after Items. And we have created a filter through which you can add custom code to product rows, and if you want, you can replace and customize the entire row. :

4 new Positions and code axample ( echo payment_status in the 4 positions)

`<?php
add_filter('nftb_order_header_message_hook', 'my_filter_function', 10, 1); 
add_filter('nftb_order_before_items_hook', 'my_filter_function', 10, 1);
add_filter('nftb_order_after_items_hook', 'my_filter_function', 10, 1);
add_filter('nftb_order_footer_message_hook', 'my_filter_function', 10, 1);

function my_filter_function($order_id) {
  $order = wc_get_order($order_id);
  if ($order) {
      // Get order details
      $order_data = $order->get_data();
  
      // Extract specific order information
      
      $payment_status = $order->get_status();
      $payment_method = $order->get_payment_method();  
  }
  return  "\r\n\r\n".$payment_method."(".$payment_status.")\r\n" ;
}
?>`

Product rows Filter with 2 different behaviors ADD or REPLACE LINE 

`<?php
add_filter('nftb_order_product_line_hook', 'my_item_line_function', 10, 3);

function my_item_line_function($message ,$product_id, $item) {

    // ADD SOME CODE $product_id TO ORIGINAL row $message.
    $modified_data = $message. "->".$product_id. "\r\n";

    // REPLACE Product ITEM LINE CODE WITH YOUR CODE  without concatenate $message.
    $modified_data = $product_id. "\r\n";

    return $modified_data;
} 
?>`

** USER LOGIN HOOKS **

`<?php
//Filter to add code on user login notification message
add_filter('nftb_login_notification', 'custom_message_modifier', 10, 1);

//Filter to add code  on user registration notification message
add_filter('nftb_user_registered_notification', 'custom_message_modifier', 10, 1);

//Filter to add code when existing user fails login notification message
add_filter('nftb_existing_user_fails_login_notification', 'custom_message_modifier', 10, 1);

//Filter to add code when unknown user fails login notification message
add_filter('nftb_unknown_user_fails_login_notification', 'custom_message_modifier', 10, 1);
  
  

// ADD User registration date to notification message
function custom_message_modifier( $user_id) {

    $user_info = get_userdata($user_id);

    if ($user_info) {
        $registration_date = $user_info->user_registered;
        $timestamp = strtotime($registration_date);
        $locale = 'it_IT'; // Italian locale
        
        $formatter = new IntlDateFormatter($locale, IntlDateFormatter::LONG, IntlDateFormatter::LONG, 'UTC');
        $formatter->setPattern('d MMMM y HH:mm:ss');
        
        $formatted_date = $formatter->format($timestamp);
        $message =  "\r\n\r\nUser gistration Date: " . $formatted_date."\r\n\r\n";
    } else {

      $message =  "\r\n No info about user ! \r\n " ;

    }
   

    return $message;
}
?>`



before the hooks we introduced 3 function so you can add things in message without changing the plug code 
We keep them for compatibility but encourage the use of hooks!!
Position in the order message are:  before items, after items, product_line

1) before the product list : (add order ID example)

	<?php function nftb_order_before_items($order_id){
    		return "ORDER ID : ".$order_id; 
		} ?php>


2) after the product list: (add order Currency example)

	<?php function nftb_order_after_items($order_id){
	 	$order = wc_get_order( $order_id );
    		$data = $order->get_data(); // order data
    		return "Currency: ".$data['currency']; 
		} ?php>

3) at the end of the line of each individual product of the order: (add product slug example)

	<?php function nftb_order_product_line($product_id,$item){
   		 $product = wc_get_product( $product_id );
    		return " | ".$product->get_slug()." ";
			} ?php>
