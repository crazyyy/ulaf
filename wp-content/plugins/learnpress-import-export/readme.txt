LearnPress Export/Import bring you feature to export course, lesson, quiz, question from a LearnPress site to back up or bring to another LearnPress site.

== Description ==

**LearnPress** is a <a href="http://thimpress.com/learnpress">WordPress LMS Plugin</a> by ThimPress.

The LearnPress Export/Import plugin is a crucial plugin for users of the LearnPress WordPress LMS plugin, designed to streamline the management of course content and data.

It addresses the common need to back up, migrate, or duplicate LearnPress courses and related elements.

**LearnPress Export/Import’s Core Functionality:**

***Course Export:***

- Allows users to export entire courses, including all data and content: lessons, quizzes, assignments), settings, curriculum, and metadata.
- The export typically generates a file (often in JSON or a custom format) that stores all the course information.

***Course Import:***

- Enables users to import courses from previously exported files.
- Allow transferring courses between different LearnPress installations or the restoration of backed-up courses.
- The import process recreates the course structure and content within the target LearnPress environment.

***Data Migration:***

- Simplifies the migration of course data when moving a LearnPress site to a new server or domain.
- Eliminates the need for manual data transfer.

***Backup and Restore:***

- Provides a reliable method for backing up LearnPress courses, ensuring data security and recovery in case of system failures or accidental removals.
- The import function allows restoring these backups.

***Duplication:***

- Facilitates the creation of duplicate courses, which is useful for creating templates or variations of existing courses.
- This can save a lot of time for course creators.

***Selective Export/Import:***

- Depending on the specific plugin version, there might be options to selectively export or import certain aspects of a course, rather than the entire course. This could mean exporting only quizzes, or lessons, for example.

The latest major feature addition to the LearnPress Export Import plugin is a streamlined, one-click migration tool for facilitating seamless transitions from other LMS systems to LearnPress. This feature will help users looking to switch LMS platforms while preserving their valuable course content, student data, and instructor information. For now, you can only convert from TutorLMS to LearnPress but our team will update more platforms in the future!

Here's a detailed breakdown of the migration tool's functions and benefits:

***Main Functionality:***

- Comprehensive Data Migration: The tool handles the migration of various crucial data points, including:

3. Quizzes: Questions, answers, and score settings are transferred, preserving the integrity of assessments.
4. Assignments: Assignment submissions and grading data are migrated, ensuring continuity of student progress.

7. Course Categories and Tags: Course categories and tags are preserved, maintaining course organization.
8. Media files: Media files related to the lessons, courses, and quizzes will also be transferred.

- Progress Tracking: The plugin provides real-time progress tracking during migration, allowing users to view the process and identify potential issues.

***Technical considerations:***

- The plugin requires both LearnPress and other LMS systems to be installed and activated on your WordPress site.
