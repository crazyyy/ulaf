A plugin to provide bulk category management functionality for media in WordPress sites.

== Description ==
This WordPress plugin will ease the management of media categories, including bulk actions.
It supports categories for media using either the existing post categories or a dedicated media_category custom taxonomy.
The plugin supports easy category toggling on the media list page view and also bulk toggling for multiple media at once.
It now also supports post tags and media taxonomies defined by other plugins.

= Main Features =

* Control your media categories via admin the same way as post categories.
* Bulk toggle any media taxonomy assignment from Media Library via admin.
* Filter media files in Media Library by your custom taxonomies, both in List and Grid view.
* Use new or existing shortcode to filter the media on galleries in posts and pages.
* Use a default category while uploading (see FAQ section). 

= Premium Features =

* Use functionality to manage whether users are allowed or disallowed to manage media.
* Use WPMCM Gallery block to filter the media on galleries in posts and pages.
* Filter media per user on several places like List or Grid view and showing media with block or shortcode.
* Export MCM Categories and / or attachment information filtered by user.
* Use WP Importer functionality for exported information, even on sites without WP MCM Premium installed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this plugin? =

On the options page, define which taxonomy to use for media: either use the standard post taxonomy, a dedicated media taxonomy or a custom media taxonomy.
Define the categories to be used for media.
Toggle category assignments to media, either individually or in bulk.
Use category filter when adding media to posts or pages.

= How do I use this plugin to support the media taxonomy of another plugin? =

There are a number of plugins available for managing media categories.
This plugin now supports the settings previously defined to support those media categories.

Check out the **MCM Settings** page which shows an option "Media Taxonomy To Use".
The dropdown list of this option shows a list of all taxonomies currently used by this WordPress installation.
The option "**(P) Categories**" is the taxonomy defined by default for posts.
The option "**MCM Categories**" is the taxonomy previously defined as "**Media Categories**" by version 1.1 and earlier of this plugin.
If there are other taxonomies currently assigned to attachments, the list shows the corresponding taxonomy slug prefixed with **(*)**.
When such a taxonomy is selected to be used, the taxonomy will be registered anew with the indication "**(*) Custom MCM Categories**".
As long as this taxonomy is selected, the functionality available for "**MCM Categories**" is now available for these "**(*) Custom MCM Categories**", i.e. toggling and filtering.
The name shown for the "**(*) Custom MCM Categories**" can be changed using the option "**Name for Custom MCM Taxonomy**" on the **MCM Settings** page.

= How can I use the "Default Media Category"? =

First enable the option "**Use Default Category**" on the **MCM Settings** page.
When enabled and a media attachment has no category defined yet, the value of "**Default Media Category**" will be assigned automatically when a media attachment is added or edited.
The default value is also used in the `[wp_mcm]` shortcode to automatically filter the attachments to be shown.

= Steps to assign a default category while uploading: =

1. Enable "Use default category" in Settings
1. Define the default category to use
1. Upload the media for this category
1. Repeat from step 2 for other categories

= How do I use the shortcode of this plugin? =

Use the `[wp_mcm]` shortcode. Various shortcode uses are explained in the **WP MCM -> Shortcodes** page.
